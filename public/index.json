I’m majoring in Computer Science \u0026amp; Artificial Intelligence with a minor in Psychology, but my story with tech started way before college.\nBack during COVID, when the world slowed down, I found myself diving into the rabbit hole of networking and cybersecurity and I never really climbed out. Since then, I’ve been building home labs, tinkering with servers, and playing around with remote networks. It’s just in my nature to break things apart, see what makes them tick, and learn by putting them back together (sometimes in better shape, sometimes… not so much). That curiosity is what sparked my obsession with tech and IT, and it keeps me hooked.\nI currently head the Cybersecurity Club at my university, where I get to share that curiosity with others, swap ideas, and geek out over challenges. I also hold ISC2’s Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) albeit a beginner cert, it is just the first step, but one that keeps me motivated to aim higher with certifications like CCNA and SSCP down the line.\nAt the heart of it, I’m someone who learns best by doing, breaking, and rebuilding. Tech isn’t just what I study, it’s something I live and breathe, and I’m excited to keep exploring where it takes me.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
