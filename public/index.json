By sending a malformed FileNormalizedNameInformation SMBv3 request over a named pipe, an attacker can cause a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crash of the Windows kernel. For most systems, this attack requires authentication, except in the special case of Windows Domain Controllers, where unauthenticated users can always open named pipes as long as they can establish an SMB session. Typically, after the BSOD, the victim SMBv3 server will reboot.\nAns: 7.8\n","date":"12 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/microsoft-windows-hardening/","section":"Writeups","summary":"","title":"Microsoft Windows Hardening","type":"writeups"},{"content":"","date":"12 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tryhackme/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"TryHackMe","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/windows/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Windows","type":"tags"},{"content":" Writeups and walkthroughs for rooms, CTFs and other challenges from TryHackMe.

I used it. I\u0026#39;ve managed to plant a few clues around the account. If you can get into the user below and look carefully, those three little \u0026#34;easter eggs\u0026#34; will combine into a passcode that unlocks a further message that I encrypted in the /home/eddi_knapp/Documents/ directory. I didn\u0026#39;t want the wrong eyes to see it. Access the user account: username: eddi_knapp password: S0mething1Sc0ming There are three hidden easter eggs. They combine to form the passcode to open my encrypted vault. Clues (one for each egg): 1) I ride with your session, not with your chest of files. Open the little bag your shell carries when you arrive. 2) The tree shows today; the rings remember yesterday. Read the ledger’s older pages. 3) When pixels sleep, their tails sometimes whisper plain words. Listen to the tail. Find the fragments, join them in order, and use the resulting passcode to decrypt the message I left.

This meant the signature was actually being validated when the role changed.\n*I went back to using the original valid guard token and tried several exploitation techniques on the /v1/streams/request endpoint itself testing missing tier fields, requesting guard cameras with admin tiers etc.\nThe breakthrough came when I tested HTTP Parameter Pollution by passing tier=admin as a URL query parameter while keeping tier=guard in the JSON body:\ncurl -X POST \u0026#34;http://10.48.191.182:13401/v1/streams/request?tier=admin\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer {valid_guard_token}\u0026#34; -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;camera_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;cam-admin\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;tier\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;guard\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; This returned \u0026quot;effective_tier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;admin\u0026quot; with a valid admin ticket, exploiting the server\u0026rsquo;s priority of query parameters over body parameters. I then accessed the real admin camera stream using the ticket ID in the manifest URL.\nThe video showed a keypad being accessed - The code 115879\nBut of course, it cant\u0026rsquo;t be this easy (even though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t).

Task 1 - Introduction # No answer needed\nTask 2 - Main Components of Metasploit # Adapters: An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.\nSingles: Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.\nStagers: Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.\nStages: Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.\n1) Name of the code taking advantage of a flaw on the target system? # Ans: Exploit\n2) Code that runs on the target system to achieve the attacker\u0026rsquo;s goal? # Ans: Payload\n3) What are self-contained payloads called? # Ans: Singles\n4) Is windows/x64/pingback_reverse_tcp\u0026quot; among singles or staged ? # Ans: Singles\nIt is an inline (or single) payload, as indicated by the _\nTask 3 - Msfconsole # 1) How would you search for a module related to Apache? # Ans: search apache\n2) Who provided the auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login module? # We can use the search functionality and then use info to get the required details\nmsf6 \u0026gt; search type:auxiliary ssh_login Matching Modules ================ # Name Disclosure Date Rank Check Description - ---- --------------- ---- ----- ----------- 0 auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login . normal No SSH Login Check Scanner 1 auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login_pubkey . normal No SSH Public Key Login Scanner msf6 \u0026gt; info 0 Name: SSH Login Check Scanner Module: auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD) Rank: Normal Provided by: todb \u0026lt;todb@metasploit.com\u0026gt; Check supported: No Basic options: Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- ANONYMOUS_LOGIN false yes Attempt to login with a blan k username and password BLANK_PASSWORDS false no Try blank passwords for all users BRUTEFORCE_SPEED 5 yes How fast to bruteforce, from 0 to 5 CreateSession true no Create a new session for eve ry successful login DB_ALL_CREDS false no Try each user/password coupl e stored in the current data base DB_ALL_PASS false no Add all passwords in the cur rent database to the list DB_ALL_USERS false no Add all users in the current database to the list DB_SKIP_EXISTING none no Skip existing credentials st ored in the current database (Accepted: none, user, user \u0026amp;realm) PASSWORD no A specific password to authe nticate with PASS_FILE no File containing passwords, o ne per line RHOSTS yes The target host(s), see http s://docs.metasploit.com/docs /using-metasploit/basics/usi ng-metasploit.html RPORT 22 yes The target port STOP_ON_SUCCESS false yes Stop guessing when a credent ial works for a host THREADS 1 yes The number of concurrent thr eads (max one per host) USERNAME no A specific username to authe nticate as USERPASS_FILE no File containing users and pa sswords separated by space, one pair per line USER_AS_PASS false no Try the username as the pass word for all users USER_FILE no File containing usernames, o ne per line VERBOSE false yes Whether to print output for all attempts Description: This module will test ssh logins on a range of machines and report successful logins.

Depending on the result our exploit paths will differ significantly.\nA non-singular curve is a curve whose certain value, called the \u0026ldquo;discriminant\u0026rdquo; of the curve, is nonzero. It holds when its parameters 𝑎 and 𝑏 satisfy the inequality:\n\\(4a^3 + 27b^2 \\not = 0\\)\nA curve that does not satisfy this inequality has a \u0026ldquo;problematic\u0026rdquo; point called a singular point. There are two types of such points: node and cusp\nWhat this means:\nThe curve has a cusp or a node (self-intersection) instead of being smooth.\nBecause of this, the set of points on the curve does not form a proper group under standard elliptic curve addition.\nThe curve does happen to be singular and is therefore vulnerable 3) Exploiting the Vulnerability # The following code from the github article exploits Elliptical Curves that are singular:\np = 8027944432202837970016382166567613248055695684315346001687786051508079095211 a = 57276030533159328146887045530181492991804891249085933575331289605 b = 4890108522805667613288743457538583820154692228816052112017335705944231712111 assert (4*a^3 + 27*b^2) % p == 0 Gx = 2105875689926932895143196884562047110500169848659102540268132432000998177662 Gy = 229423364975599771276867046437732535419264207423006298355584008095715972502 Qx = 3685899851710902647676109902198159056110437731756939136804788198715504103708 Qy = 259383739652175557073121224113233231149464856533427701609450332409012223263 x = GF(p)[\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;].gen() f = x^3 + a*x + b roots = f.roots() assert len(roots) == 2 # two roots, so one must be double if roots[0][1] == 2: double_root = roots[0][0] single_root = roots[1][0] else: double_root = roots[1][0] single_root = roots[0][0] print(\u0026#34;double root:\u0026#34;, double_root) print(\u0026#34;single root:\u0026#34;, single_root) # map G and Q to the new \u0026#34;shifted\u0026#34; curve Gx = (Gx - double_root) Qx = (Qx - double_root) # Transform G and Q into numbers g and q, such that q=g^n t = double_root - single_root t_sqrt = t.square_root() def transform(x, y, t_sqrt): return (y + t_sqrt * x) / (y - t_sqrt * x) g = transform(Gx, Gy, t_sqrt) q = transform(Qx, Qy, t_sqrt) print(\u0026#34;g:\u0026#34;, g) print(\u0026#34;q:\u0026#34;, q) # Find the private key n print(\u0026#34;Factors of p-1:\u0026#34;, factor(p-1)) print(\u0026#34;Calculating discrete log for g and q...\u0026#34;) found_key = discrete_log(q, g) print(\u0026#34;Found private key:\u0026#34;, found_key) from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes print(\u0026#34;The secret is:\u0026#34;, long_to_bytes(found_key).decode()) When I first tried it worked almost \u0026rsquo;too-well\u0026rsquo;.

I’m majoring in Computer Science \u0026amp; Artificial Intelligence with a minor in Psychology, but my story with tech started way before college.\nBack during COVID, when the world slowed down, I found myself diving into the rabbit hole of networking and cybersecurity and I never really climbed out. Since then, I’ve been building home labs, tinkering with servers, and playing around with remote networks. It’s just in my nature to break things apart, see what makes them tick, and learn by putting them back together (sometimes in better shape, sometimes… not so much). That curiosity is what sparked my obsession with tech and IT, and it keeps me hooked.\nI currently head the Cybersecurity Club at my university, where I get to share that curiosity with others, swap ideas, and geek out over challenges. I also hold ISC2’s Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) albeit a beginner cert, it is just the first step, but one that keeps me motivated to aim higher with certifications like CCNA and SSCP down the line.\nAt the heart of it, I’m someone who learns best by doing, breaking, and rebuilding. Tech isn’t just what I study, it’s something I live and breathe, and I’m excited to keep exploring where it takes me.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
