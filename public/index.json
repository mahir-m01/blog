I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet explored the deeper waters of cryptography and this one was pretty new to me. But hey, thats the essence of CTFs and I always appreciate a CTF that encourages you to explore and research instead of expecting you to know everything to be able to solve the question it offers. And during my research, I came across an amazing github repo article that explains Elliptical Curve Cryptography beautifully. My colleagues are sick and tired of hearing me say this but it is one of the best explanations to any topic I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered thus far.\n","date":"29 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/elliptical-curve-cryptography/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"ECC is interesting","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Hi, I’m Mahir. I’m majoring in Computer Science \u0026amp; Artificial Intelligence with a minor in Psychology, but my story with tech started way before college.\nBack during COVID, when the world slowed down, I found myself diving into the rabbit hole of networking and cybersecurity and I never really climbed out. Since then, I’ve been building home labs, tinkering with servers, and playing around with remote networks. It’s just in my nature to break things apart, see what makes them tick, and learn by putting them back together (sometimes in better shape, sometimes… not so much). That curiosity is what sparked my obsession with tech and IT, and it keeps me hooked.\nI currently head the Cybersecurity Club at my university, where I get to share that curiosity with others, swap ideas, and geek out over challenges. I also hold ISC2’s Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) albeit a beginner cert, it is just the first step, but one that keeps me motivated to aim higher with certifications like CCNA and SSCP down the line.\nAt the heart of it, I’m someone who learns best by doing, breaking, and rebuilding. Tech isn’t just what I study, it’s something I live and breathe, and I’m excited to keep exploring where it takes me.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
