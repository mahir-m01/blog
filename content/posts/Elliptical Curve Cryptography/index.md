I was reviewing a CTF that my friend shared with me and I came across a question about 'Elliptical Curve Cryptography'. I haven't yet explored the deeper waters of cryptography and this one was pretty new to me. But hey, thats the essence of CTFs and I always appreciate a CTF that encourages you to explore and research instead of expecting you to know everything to be able to solve the question it offers. 
And during my research, I came across an amazing github repo article that explains Elliptical Curve Cryptography beautifully. My colleagues are sick and tired of hearing me say this but it is one of the best explanations to any topic I've encountered thus far.
