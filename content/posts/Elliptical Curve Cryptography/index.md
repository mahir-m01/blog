I was reviewing a CTF that my friend shared with me and I came across a question about 'Elliptical Curve Cryptography'....

Ah fellow hunters, how did you manage to stumble upon here ? Well hats off for taking the effort but for now the ECC content is *temporarily* removed - for obvious reasons. Well, if you made it this far, I'm sure you'll take the extra effort to research about it and figure it out. Good luck then. Happy hunting !
